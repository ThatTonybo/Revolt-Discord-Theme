<p align="center">A theme that aims to skin Revolt to look as close as possible to Discord</p>

> **Temporary Disclaimer:** The most recent client update has forced most theme changes to break. We (contributors and myself) are working to fix these as soon as possible.

## Install
- Open `dist/theme.json` and copy the contents
- Go to Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced Options and click the small "Import a theme" button

## Bugs
> At this time, Revolt does not have [consistent class naming](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite/issues/149), meaning that themes may partially break at any time

If you find any bugs, report them using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThatTonybo/Revolt-Discord-Theme/issues)

### Known Bugs
- Typing indicator goes off screen on mobile
