## Install
- Open `dist/theme.json` and copy the contents to clipboard.
- Go to `Settings -> Appearance -> Theme Overrides` and click the small "Import a theme" button to the right of the first text box. This will import your theme **from your clipboard**, make sure you have it copied and have allowed Revolt to read your clipboard.

## Bugs
> At this time, Revolt does not have [consistent class naming](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite/issues/149), meaning that themes may partially break at any time

If you find any bugs, report them using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThatTonybo/Revolt-Discord-Theme/issues)
