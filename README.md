# Revolt Discord Theme
A theme that aims to skin Revolt to look as close as possible to Discord


## Install
- Open `theme.css` and copy the contents
- Go to Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced Options and click the small "Import a theme" button

## Bugs
- At this time, Revolt does not have [consistent class naming](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite/issues/149), meaning that themes may partially break at any time
If you find any bugs, report them using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThatTonybo/Revolt-Discord-Theme/issues)
