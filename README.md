## Bugs
> At this time, Revolt does not have [consistent class naming](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite/issues/149), meaning that themes may partially break at any time

If you find any bugs, report them using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ThatTonybo/Revolt-Discord-Theme/issues)

### Known Bugs
- Server indicators are partially broken (hover effect and selected effects don't work)
- The typing indicator's margin on the right side of the message box expands too far
